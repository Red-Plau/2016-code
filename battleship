#Battleship game. Not revised for optimisation.

from random import randint

board = []

print("""BATTLESHIP PLAYER. Another project done for my Computer Science class in 2016.

RULES:
1- The board ranges from 1 to 5 rows and 1 to 5 columns. Guessing outside of that range hits outside of the board.
2- You have 3 turns to find and sink the battleship.

MORE FINE TUNING TO COME. I found this little game cute.
